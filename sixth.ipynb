    "## Q1- Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "#### Answer:\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated"

    " ## Q2- List down the benefits of OOP?\n",
    " #### Answer:\n",
    "OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs.\n",
    "It is good for defining abstract data types.\n",
    "Implementation details are hidden from other modules and other modules has a clearly defined interface.\n",
    "It is easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.\n",
    "objects, methods, instance, message passing, inheritance are some important properties provided by these particular languages\n",
    "encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction are also counts in these fundamentals of programming language.\n",
    "It implements real life scenario.\n",
    "In OOP, programmer not only defines data types but also deals with operations applied for data structures.\n"

    "##### Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Functions have independent existence means they can be defined outside of the class. Ex:- main() function in C, C++ Language\n",
    "2-Functions are defined in structured languages like Pascal,C and object based language like javaScript\n",
    "3-Functions do not have any reference variable.\n",
    "4-Functions are self describing unit of code.\n",
    "5-All data that are passed to a function are explicitly passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Methods do not have independent existence they are always defined with in class. Ex:- main() method in C# Language that is defined with in a class\n",
    "2-Methods are defined in object oriented languages like C#, Java\n",
    "3-Methods are called using reference variable.\n",

    "# Q4- Define following terms:\n",
    "What is Class?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is an entity that determines how an object will behave and what the object will contain. In other words, it is a blueprint or a set of instruction to build a specific type of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an Object?\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is nothing but a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make a particular type of data useful. Object determines the behavior of the class. When you send a message to an object, you are asking the object to invoke or execute one of its methods.\n",
    "From a programming point of view, an object can be a data structure, a variable or a function. It has a memory location allocated. The object is designed as class hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is attribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "DescriptionIn computing, an attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such. For clarity, attributes should more correctly be considered metadata. An attribute is frequently and generally a property of a property. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is behavior?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will \"react\" if asked to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them.\n"
